Hi! 

If you are reading this text, you probably want to create **cool** projects with Node.js, and yes, you're in the **right place**!

Here I'll list all the projects implemented based on the software specifications created at the [app-specs](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs/).

> If you liked this idea, you can help us creating more specifications or implementing more applications and share with us! Take a look at the [contribution guide](https://github.com/ericdouglas/app-specs#how-to-collaborate)!

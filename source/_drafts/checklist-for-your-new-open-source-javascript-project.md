In this post, I'll synthesize the main lessons really well passed by [Kent C. Dodds](https://twitter.com/kentcdodds) in his series "How to Write an Open Source JavaScript Library". Check his course on egghead.io [here](https://egghead.io/series/how-to-write-an-open-source-javascript-library). 

After watching the course, you can use this checklist to quickly refresh your mind and remember of each step you need to do in order to create your next open-source project.
